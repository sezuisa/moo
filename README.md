The MoodTracker App was developed by Sandro Bühler and Sarah Hägele during their 5th semester. The app allows users to log their mood and add their highlight of the day as well as a brief note. Users can also view their mood history and see a weekly mood statistics report.

## Features

The MoodTracker App provides the following features:

-   Mood logging: Users can select and save their current mood.
-   Adding a highlight: Users can add and save a highlight of their day.
-   Adding a note: Users can add and save a brief note about their day.
-   Mood history: Users can view the maps of the last days to track their mood changes over time.
-   Weekly statistics: Users can view a statistical report of their mood over the past week.

## Technology

The MoodTracker App was developed using the Kotlin programming language in Android Studio. The backend uses Realm in conjunction with MongoDB to manage user authentication and maps.
